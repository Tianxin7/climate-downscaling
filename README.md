The RCP4.5 scenario data produced by five models of CMIP5 (MIROC_ESM_CHEM, CanESM2, HadGEM2-ES, INMCM4, and NorESM1-M) were obtained through https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/cmip5/, the SSP245 scenario data produced by eleven models of CMIP6 (AWI-CM-1-1-MR, BCC-CSM2-MR, CAMS-CSMI-0, CAS-ESM2-0, CESM2-WACCM, CMCC-CM2-SR5, CMCC-ESM2, MPI-ESMI-2-HR, MRI-ESM2-0, NorESM2-MM, and TaiESM1) were obtained through https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/cmip6/, the DEM with a spatial resolution of 90 m was obtained through USGS/NASA http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org, and the observational monthly temperature at 30 stations in Tianshan was obtained through http://data.cma.cn.
